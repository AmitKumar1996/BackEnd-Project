Testing Controller(return type) is not enough, we have to test end to end API.













1.IntelliJ Idea Not working Properly 

Explanation of the JVM Options
These JVM options control the memory usage of IntelliJ IDEA, ensuring smoother performance and preventing potential UI freezes or glitches caused by memory exhaustion.

1. -Xms512m
This option sets the initial heap size (memory allocated at startup) to 512 MB.

If the initial heap size is too small, IntelliJ IDEA may run out of memory quickly when working on large projects, causing performance issues or UI lags.
By setting this to 512 MB, we ensure IntelliJ starts with sufficient memory to handle typical workloads.
2. -Xmx2048m
This option sets the maximum heap size to 2048 MB (2 GB).

This is the upper limit of memory that the JVM can allocate.
If IntelliJ IDEA reaches this limit, it may slow down or become unresponsive because it cannot allocate more memory.
By increasing the limit to 2 GB, you reduce the chances of memory-related UI freezes.
3. -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m
This option sets the size of the Reserved Code Cache to 512 MB.

The Reserved Code Cache is a special memory region used by the JVM to store compiled code (i.e., code that the JVM optimizes at runtime using JIT—Just-In-Time compilation).
When this cache fills up, it can cause significant performance issues, including UI lags and unresponsiveness in applications like IntelliJ IDEA.
By increasing it to 512 MB, you ensure the JVM has enough space for JIT-compiled code, improving performance and reducing UI glitches.
Why Did This Fix the Problem?
The issue was likely caused by insufficient memory or a full code cache. When IntelliJ runs out of memory or the code cache is exhausted:

UI freezes or lags occur because garbage collection (GC) kicks in frequently to reclaim memory.
Touchpad input stops working because the IDE becomes unresponsive during these GC cycles or due to rendering issues when there isn’t enough memory for the UI thread.
By increasing the heap size and code cache, the JVM now has more room to:

Handle large projects without running out of memory.
Optimize the application using JIT compilation without exhausting the code cache.
Ensure smoother performance and prevent UI glitches or freezes.
Will This Issue Happen Again?
With the increased memory settings, it is less likely to happen again unless you work on extremely large projects that need more than 2 GB of heap memory.
If you notice similar issues in the future, you can further increase -Xmx to 4096 MB (4 GB) and -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize to 1 GB.
Recommended Final Settings
plaintext
Copy code
-Xms512m
-Xmx4096m
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m
This configuration provides enough memory for large-scale projects and reduces the chances of UI-related issues.
